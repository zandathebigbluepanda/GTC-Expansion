This is a warning I am not a java dev, I am a web designer, I am very stupid, and this is the first time since I was 13 that I've done any MC development.

All that said, this is just an update so this mod works with Vintage gregtech instead of gregtech classic.
Please note some things are broken, but most things should be working, I've done some limited testing so let me know if you have any issues.
